                    Security vehicle patrol officer is a specific type of security guard who provides

                    and patrols an outdoor property rather than guarding a specific building like 
                    other security guards.

                    Bodyguards have a duty to protect an individual. Customers can choose to 
                    have an armed or unarmed bodyguard.  They are useful in escorting the 
                    clients in public settings. Managing large crowds. Identifying suspicious 
                    behavior or unauthorized people. Driving the client and safely fleeing the 
                    scene of a security threat.
